# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey, I’m Kirthiraj

📍 Based in Chicago
🎓 MS Graduate navigating the U.S. tech world

🌱 What I’m Currently Doing

Building myself — one project, one lesson, and one challenge at a time.

I recently completed my Master’s and I’m focused on growing into a strong, reliable engineer who builds things that actually make life easier for people. I care about clarity, efficiency, and creating systems that don’t fall apart under pressure.

🤝 I’m Looking to Collaborate On

Meaningful projects with real-world impact

Ideas that solve everyday inefficiencies

Teams that value learning, growth, and ownership

Anything that pushes me outside my comfort zone

🌎 The Honest Part

Being a recent graduate in today’s U.S. job market isn’t easy.

It’s competitive.
It’s uncertain.
It tests your confidence.

But it’s also teaching me resilience, discipline, and how to keep showing up even when things don’t go as planned. Every rejection strengthens my preparation. Every project sharpens my skills.

I’m not just chasing opportunities — I’m building long-term capability.
