I’m someone who believes growth is built quietly  through consistency, resilience, and showing up every single day.
I recently completed my Master’s, and I’m now navigating the U.S. job market with focus, patience, and determination. It’s competitive. It’s unpredictable. But it’s shaping me into a stronger, sharper, and more disciplined version of myself.

🌎 The Journey 

Being a recent graduate in today’s market tests you.
It tests your confidence.

But I’ve learned that resilience compounds. Every rejection builds preparation. Every setback builds perspective. Every day of consistency builds momentum.
I’m here for the long game.
